# Bounty-App
### the bounty app is an auction for issues.

1. Devs participate by placing their bids. A bid includes the estimated h for the issue * the $ per h  and the devs portfolio (github, linkedin etc.). 
2. The auction runs until a certain amount of bids. When reached the auction is over, and no more bids can be placed.
3. token holders vote on the devs bids/proposals via the [Governance App](https://github.com/mylife-plus/Governance-App). The one with the most votes gets the issue. If for some reason the dev doesn't perform the dev with the second most votes get chosen.
